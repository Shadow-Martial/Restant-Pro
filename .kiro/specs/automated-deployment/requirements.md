# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement automated deployment for the Laravel multi-tenant SaaS platform using GitHub Actions and Dokku. The system will automatically deploy code changes to the production server (Ubuntu 24.04.3, IP: 209.50.227.94) using subdomain deployment pattern (restant.susankshakya.com.np) when changes are pushed to specific branches. The deployment will integrate with Sentry for error monitoring, self-hosted Flagsmith for feature flags, and Grafana Cloud for observability, ensuring a streamlined and reliable deployment process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment triggered by GitHub pushes, so that I can deploy code changes without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a deployment workflow
2. WHEN code is pushed to a staging branch THEN the system SHALL deploy to a staging environment
3. IF the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL notify the development team and halt the process
4. WHEN deployment is successful THEN the system SHALL update the live application without downtime

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Dokku configured on the server with subdomain deployment, so that I can manage containerized deployments efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dokku is installed THEN the system SHALL support Git-based deployments
2. WHEN an app is created in Dokku THEN the system SHALL automatically configure necessary services (database, Redis, etc.)
3. WHEN deploying THEN Dokku SHALL use subdomain pattern restant.{subdomain}.susankshakya.com.np
4. IF SSL is required THEN Dokku SHALL automatically provision Let's Encrypt certificates for subdomains
5. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN Dokku SHALL manage them securely

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper build and deployment configuration, so that the Laravel application runs correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL run composer install with production optimizations
2. WHEN assets need compilation THEN the system SHALL run npm build processes
3. WHEN database changes exist THEN the system SHALL run migrations automatically
4. WHEN cache needs clearing THEN the system SHALL optimize Laravel caches for production

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and rollback capabilities, so that I can ensure deployment reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment starts THEN the system SHALL log all deployment steps
2. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version
3. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify application health
4. IF health checks fail THEN the system SHALL trigger rollback procedures

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations, so that different environments can have appropriate settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to staging THEN the system SHALL use staging environment variables
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use production environment variables
3. IF sensitive data is required THEN the system SHALL use secure secret management
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL not expose secrets in logs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Sentry integration for error monitoring, so that I can track and debug application errors in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN Sentry SDK SHALL be configured and active
2. WHEN an error occurs THEN Sentry SHALL capture and report the error with context
3. WHEN deployment happens THEN Sentry SHALL track deployment releases
4. IF performance monitoring is enabled THEN Sentry SHALL collect performance metrics

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want self-hosted Flagsmith for feature flags, so that I can control feature rollouts independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Flagsmith is deployed THEN the system SHALL use docker-compose from the official repository
2. WHEN the Laravel app starts THEN it SHALL connect to the Flagsmith instance for feature flags
3. WHEN feature flags change THEN the application SHALL respect the new flag values
4. IF Flagsmith is unavailable THEN the application SHALL use default flag values

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want Grafana Cloud integration, so that I can monitor application and infrastructure metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL send metrics to Grafana Cloud
2. WHEN system resources are monitored THEN Grafana SHALL collect infrastructure metrics
3. WHEN application performance is tracked THEN Grafana SHALL receive APM data
4. IF alerts are configured THEN Grafana SHALL notify on threshold breaches

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a team member, I want deployment notifications, so that I can track deployment status and issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment starts THEN the system SHALL notify the team via configured channels
2. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL send success notifications with deployment details
3. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL send failure notifications with error details
4. WHEN rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL notify about the rollback action and reason
